      <h3>Getting Started with Prettier</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and
      integrates seamlessly with VS Code. To get started, you&#39;ll need to
      install the extension and configure your editor settings. Once installed,
      Prettier can automatically format your code on save, ensuring consistent
      code style across your entire project. This is especially useful when
      working in teams, as it eliminates style-related discussions and maintains
      a uniform codebase.
